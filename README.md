# Fivem-Postal-Box-Theft-Script

Enhance your FiveM server with a simple and immersive mail theft script. This script lets players target mailboxes around the city to steal packages and earn cash or itemsâ€”adding a fresh roleplay element without unnecessary complexity.

## Features

- **Interactive Mailboxes**  
  Players can approach and interact with mailboxes throughout the map to initiate theft.

- **Randomized Rewards**  
  Earn cash and items from stolen mail. The loot pool is fully configurable to suit your server's economy.

- **Police Alerts**  
  A configurable chance to alert law enforcement during theft attempts, adding a realistic element of risk.

- **Cooldown & Anti-Spam**  
  Theft attempts are limited per location, with a lockout period after a successful attempt to prevent abuse.

- **Engaging Minigame**  
  A simple minigame challenge is presented during theft attempts, enhancing interactivity.

- **Realistic Roleplay**  
  Players must remain near the mailbox during the theft; moving too far cancels the attempt.
